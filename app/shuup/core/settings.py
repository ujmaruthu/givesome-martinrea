#: A list of order labels (2-tuples of internal identifier / visible name).
#:
#: Order labels serve as a simple taxonomy layer for easy "tagging" of orders even within

#: order labels, which are can then be used in reports, admin filtering, etc.

#: The format of this setting is a list of 2-tuples of dict key / visible name,
#: for example ``[("ssn", "Social Security Number")]``.

#: For installations where customizations may save some information, that is both

#: SHUUP_ADDRESS_FIELD_PROPERTIES = {
#:    "postal_code": {"required": True}
#: }
#:
#: Some of the Django form field properties will not affect Address API.
#: The valid set of properties are those defined by the Serializer fields core arguments
#: like `read_only`, `required`, `allow_null`, etc. See the Django Rest Framework documentation

#:
#: It should be noted, however, that overriding some of the settings (such as making a

#:
#: Shuup will iterate over all handlers in order to determinate
#: if some of them can handle the error. In case of no handlers able to
#: do the job, a blank response will be returned.
#:

#: The task runner is an object that can handle dynamic task execution
#: by receiving a function spec and a set of arguments.
#:
#: Custom task runners can be implemented to enable asynchronous
#: execution through tools like Celery.
#:
#: The default implementation is a basic task runner that will
#: load the function and call it passing the arguments received.
